# amasiBlog

amasiBlog is a simple blog system where users can **view, create, edit, and delete blog posts**. It is built using **PHP, MySQL, HTML, and JavaScript** to provide a dynamic and user-friendly blogging experience.

## Features

- View all blog posts
- Create new blog posts
- Edit existing posts
- Delete posts
- **Automatic database setup** (no need to create the database manually)
  - When the application starts, it **checks** if a **MySQL database named `BlogDB`** exists.
  - If `BlogDB` **is found**, the app starts normally.
  - If `BlogDB` **does not exist**, it is **automatically created** using [`config/createDatabase.php`](config/createDatabase.php).
  - The required tables are set up from [`config/db_setup.php`](config/db_setup.php).
- **Efficient data handling with JavaScript**
  - Data is stored in a **JavaScript array** locally after it is retrieved from the database.
  - When a user **adds, deletes, or updates a post**, the local array is updated **without needing to re-fetch data from the database**.
  - The app updates the UI instantly after receiving a success message from the database via PHP APIs, improving performance and reducing unnecessary database calls.
- **Local search functionality**
  - When searching for a post, the application **filters the local JavaScript array** instead of making a new database request.
  - If a match is found, only the relevant posts are displayed.
  - If no match is found, the user is informed that no results are available.
